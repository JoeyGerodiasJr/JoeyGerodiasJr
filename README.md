# Hi there! 👋 I'm Joey Gerodias 

## About Me

Joey Gerodias
BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science)
I believe that before data can tell a compelling story, it must first speak the truth. My role is to be its editor—removing the noise, correcting the errors, and ensuring its narrative is clear and consistent. With a foundation in Computer Science, I architect the processes that transform chaotic data into a coherent and trustworthy source, enabling businesses to write their next chapter with confidence.
